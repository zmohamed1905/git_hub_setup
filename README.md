# Python Intro


## Why Python:
- Python is a popular, in demand programming langauge.
- Easy to use for beginners
- Supported by large libraries


# Python use cases 
- Internet of things
- Game Development
- Artificial Intelligence
- Data Science


# Python Variables
- Variables help to store data values
- To store user data- hard code the data- any other type

# Here are some examples:
- first_name = "" - String
- last_name = ""
- DOB = 99- Int
- UK_resident= yes or no - Boolean
- salary = 40000 - Int
- travel = 15.4 - float
- gross_salary = salary + travel

# Below is an example of some code and variables in practice:


```python



first_name = "Zakariya"
last_name = "Mohamed"
salary = 50
travel = 3.5

#print("Zakariya")
print(first_name)
# display the value of var first_name
print(last_name)
print(salary)
print(travel)

#how to find out the type of data stored in the var
# type()
print(type(travel))
# interact with users by taking user data in - input

print("Good Morning, Please enter your name ")
name = input() # took user input and stored in the var called name
print("Hello dear")
print(name)

print("What is your first name?")
first_name = input()
print("What is your last name?")
last_name = input()
print("What is your DOB")
DOB = input()
print("What is your course name?")
course_name = input()
print("Are you a UK resident?")
UK_resident = input()
```
